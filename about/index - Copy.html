	<br>
	<p>My name is Kevin Ballantyne and I am a geomatics developer & analyst from 
	Ottawa, Canada.</p>

	<p>Although I have over 10 years experience in geomatics, geography has been 
	a life-long interest of mine. Growing up, I could not travel anywhere without 
	a map in my hand. As I explored more topics in geography, I took an interest 
	in urban planning and began to research the development of the Ottawa area. 
	While getting my Honours B.A. in Geography at Carleton University, I 
	discovered geomatics. Since it combined my interest in geography and 
	my interests in computers and programming, I was hooked. There was no limit 
	in topics that could be applied to geomatics.</p>

	<p>I have lived in Ottawa all my life. My great-great grandfather came to 
	the Ottawa area in 1870 and lived in (Old) Ottawa East. He and his brother 
	became involved in the local government as well as the community. Much of 
	my interests in Ottawa and its history began with discovering my family's 
	history. One of my ancestors, James Ballantyne, took photos of the Ottawa 
	area. These photos, for me, provided a glimpse into Ottawa's past. It was 
	the starting point for my project on the 
	<a href="../geomatics/bygone-buildings-ottawa">
		former buildings of Ottawa.
	</a>
	</p>

	<p>Another passion in life is 
	<a href="../music">
		music
	</a>
	. I play guitar, piano and drums. In my 
	spare time I like to record my own songs and I have been writing for the 
	past 8 years. If I was to choose a genre to describe my music, it would be 
	Alternative Folk.</p>

	<p>In my spare time, I have combined some of my interests with geomatics. 
	I try to find ways to convey my research into a view-able map. With my 
	research into former buildings of Ottawa, I found a way to display results 
	as a web map (KML file).</p>

	<p>In recent years, my choice of software has turned to open source 
	applications in geomatics. In my profession and personal projects, I use 
	different open source software, such as OSGeo, QGIS, GDAL and Python. Open 
	source technology constantly changes as developers from the open source 
	community continue to modify applications. I find the customization options 
	which open source software provides to be beneficial in what I produce.</p>
	<br>

	<h3 class="pg-subtitle">What I do</h3>
	<br>
	<p>I am a Geomatics Specialist at MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) 
	and have been with the company since 2010. I produce digital elevation 
	models (DEMs) using Radarsat-2 imagery and I also help develop and 
	automate the process that is used in the production of the DEMs. I work 
	with 3D-editing software, such as Socet Set, and a variety of other 
	software, such as Global Mapper, Python, GDAL, SAGA GIS and ArcGIS, in 
	order to produce the DEMs.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3 class="pg-subtitle">What I've done</h3>
	<br>
	<p>Before MDA, I worked at Intermap for almost 3 years. My first position 
	there involved editing DEMs using their software. Later, I got a new 
	position in the delivery of the DEMs where I was able to expand my skills 
	using 3rd party software.</p>

	<p>My main focus during my studies (2001-2006) was geomatics but I also 
	took several computer science courses to improve my programming skills. 
	My honours paper was on web mapping, a relatively new topic at the time.</p>

	<p>Prior to graduation, my work experience was summer jobs with the 
	federal government. I worked at Environment Canada for about a year 
	(between 2005-2006) helping with the design of their environmental 
	indicators website. My experience with web mapping tools for the 
	indicators website was the motivation for my honours paper topic. 
	I also worked at Natural Resources Canada for 3 summers (1999-2001) 
	helping with the editing of topographical maps and creating their 
	application for accessing the National Topographic System.</p>
