		<p class="pad-left-20">Born and raised in Ottawa, music has always been a part of Kevin Ballantyne’s life. From wearing out his father’s vinyl collection at a young age to writing and recording his own songs 25 years later, music has been a life-long passion. Beginning with piano at age 8, he started playing guitar in 2000 and has never looked back, although he still dabbles on the keys and drums occasionally.</p>
		<p class="pad-left-20">In 2007, Kevin began writing and recording his own songs based on personal experience, historical events or odd stories. His songs usually have a folk-rock feel to them, although he sometimes enjoys writing in other genres, such as alternative, punk, synth-pop and even metal. Over time, he recorded enough songs to release 2 albums, <a href="/music/albums/drunk-on-a-bike">Drunk On A Bike</a> in 2011 and <a href="/music/albums/a-poet-and-a-one-man-band">A Poet & A One Man Band</a> in 2014.</p>
		<p class="pad-left-20">Today, Kevin continues to write and record as new ideas bring new songs to life. His collection of songs has continued to grow and he hopes to release a new album in the near future. The new album will continue his exploration into folk-rock territory with some excursions into other genres.</p>
