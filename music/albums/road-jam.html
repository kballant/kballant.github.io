									A train whistles on the breeze<br>
									The highway whispers through the air<br>
									As I swing beneath the maple trees<br>

									I remember those country days<br>
									I remember the fun we had<br>
									I remember those country days<br>
									So far away<br>
									<br>
									Camping out beneath the stars<br>
									Coyotes have something to say<br>
									The crickets blanket the night<br>
									The constellations light the way<br>
									<br>
									[Chorus]<br>
									<br>
									Exploring around the grey wood barn<br>
									Let’s hide and seek before we rest<br>
									Climbing log fences and sand hills<br>
									A dinner at night with nature’s best<br>
									<br>
									I remember those country days<br>
									I remember the fun we had<br>
									I enjoyed all those country days<br>

				<p class="album">
					With a gap of about 9 years since my last album, <span class="bold">Road Jam</span> reflects events and 
					ideas from nearly the last decade. As usual, most, if not all, songs on this album originate from personal experiences.
				</p>
				<p class="album">
					‘<span class="bold">Let's Rock</span>’ is based on a jam
					with some friends. We played until the neighbours hit the walls.
				</p>
				<p class="album">
					Both ‘<span class="bold">Aninaatig</span>’ 
					and ‘<span class="bold">Jet Off Into The Night</span>’ are based on one place, my aunt and uncle's farm near Perth, Ontario. 
					The farm was named Aninaatig meaning 'maple tree' in Ojibwe. The former song is based on my childhood memories
					of the farm. Although 'Jet Off Into The Night' was something a friend of mine once said, the words are based on 
					the many times we bid farewell to my uncle as we left the farm at night.
				</p>
				<p class="album">
					‘<span class="bold">Running To Nowhere</span>’ I wrote about the passing of a good friend of mine in 2021. This album is 
					dedicated to his memory.
				</p>
				<p class="album">
					‘<span class="bold">The Rocketship Is Gone</span>’ is about some of my memories of my grandparents' house in Elmvale Acres, a community it Ottawa. 
					I wrote the chorus while I was driving around the neighbourhood. As a child, I always remembered a lighthouse, rocketship and train outside 
					the Museum of Science & Technology. However, on this drive I noticed the rocketship was gone. I was relieved to see the lighthouse was still there 
					as a reminder of my childhood. While somethings may change, other things can stay the same.
				</p>
				<p class="album">
					There are a few songs that I wrote based on some of my travels. The title of 
					‘<span class="bold">All Roads Lead To Salida</span>’ came when I was in Chile and my cousin
					and I saw all these signs pointing to 'salida'. My cousin said "I guess all roads lead 
					to salida" without us knowing that 'salida' means exit. The chorus to 
					‘<span class="bold">Let The Sun Shine On Me</span>’ I wrote while on a high-speed train in Japan. 
					‘<span class="bold">The Western Pines</span>’ is about my experience when going for a short hike 
					at Whistler in British Columbia.
				</p>
				<p class="album">
					‘<span class="bold">One More For The Road</span>’ is about looking for new opportunities in life as I wrote it around the time I was looking for work.
