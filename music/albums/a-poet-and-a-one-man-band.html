									It all started when I was young<br>
									Out on the streets<br>
									I learned to get around<br>
									To always feel the heat<br>
									Don't waste your time on me<br>
									Just let me be<br>
									<br>
									Chorus:<br>
									In and out all my life<br>
									I can't play by your rules<br>
									In and out all my life<br>
									I won't be nobody's fool<br>
									In and out<br>
									<br>
									You can say I'm troubled<br>
									You can say I'm dumb<br>
									I don’t care what you say<br>
									I’ll just have my fun<br>
									Don't waste your time on me<br>
									Just let me be<br>
									<br>
									[Chorus]<br>
									<br>
									Analysed, criticised<br>
									Throughout my life<br>
									Put away, here I'll stay<br>
									I’ll take it in stride<br>
									<br>
									I can’t count how many times<br>
									To this place I’ve been<br>
									Every time that I get caught<br>
									Freedom’s running thin<br>
									Don't waste your time on me<br>
									Just let me be<br>
									<br>

									In and out the islands wind<br>
									Beauty-land, wonder-land, all combined<br>
									The blue above and the blue below<br>
									Blending together as we all row<br>
									<br>
									What radiant beauty the sunbeams make<br>
									In their quivering pattern across the lake<br>
									Softly the clouds move to and fro<br>
									All mirrored in the depths below<br>
									<br>
									Can you hear the loons drifting across the bay?<br>
									Feel their echo so oft far away<br>
									Hear, O hear the white-laps roar<br>
									Their foaming breakers against the shore<br>
									<br>
									Hear the whispering in the trees<br>
									Made by the soft caressing breeze<br>
									Do you know an Island Big where the forest sings<br>
									With the glimmering trails and mossy springs?<br>
									<br>
									Can you hear the loons drifting across the bay?<br>
									And their echo so oft far away<br>
									Hear, O hear the white-laps roar<br>
									Their foaming breakers against the shore<br>
									<br>
									The mountains are lighted with sunset hues<br>
									Soon they'll be darkened in deepest blues<br>
									See the water dancing bright<br>
									Under the moon-beam's mystic light<br>
									<br>
									A rabbit here and a squirrel there<br>
									Birds making melody everywhere<br>
									A changing view every turn we take<br>
									In all its moods we love Blue Sea Lake

				<p class="album">
					With my second album, <span class="italic bold">A Poet & A One Man Band</span>,
					the styles of music are more succinct. I’ve always liked both folk 
					music and hard rock so most of the songs on this album are these 
					genres. I did however sneak in a synth-pop inspired song on a dare 
					(‘<span class="bold">Is That What We’re Looking For?</span>’).
				</p>
				<p class="album">
					As with my first album, the lyrics are based on personal experience.
				</p>
				<p class="album">
					Some are still stories but their origins are from experiences and 
					not just titles. In the case of ‘<span class="bold">In And Out</span>’, 
					I wrote it after meeting someone on a train to Toronto. The gentleman, 
					who had just been released from a detention centre, was caught smoking 
					on the train and was detained at the next stop. 
					'<span class="bold">I Just Turned 19 And My Liver Is Shot</span>' 
					is somewhat personal experience. A group of us were out celebrating 
					the 19th birthday of the brother of one of my friends. This line 
					came up sometime in the night.
				</p>
				<p class="album">
					The times spent at my cottage also feature in my songs and lyrics. 
					‘<span class="bold">Blue Sea Lake</span>’ is the name of the lake 
					which my cottage resides. The words in the song are from a poem 
					written by one of the original cottagers on the lake. In front of 
					my cottage stands a tall hemlock tree where I used to stare out 
					from the window and let my mind wander. This became the first 
					line and theme for ‘<span class="bold">Come Summer’s End</span>’. 
					‘<span class="bold">Deep In The Heart of The Night</span>’ was 
					the first song I wrote with words. They represent my 
					wild imagination while I struggled to sleep in the dark nights 
					at the cottage.
				</p>
				<p class="album">
					As for some of the other songs, 
					'<span class="bold">Where Has The Time Gone?</span>' 
					I wrote when I turned 30, '<span class="bold">For Every Name</span>' 
					I wrote on Remembrance Day and 
					'<span class="bold">Some Peace of Mind</span>' 
					was written for a friend who was going through some troubled times.
				</p>
				<p class="album">
					The painting was painted by my brother Neil and was inspired 
					by the song 'Homeward Bound' by Simon & Garfunkel. The title 
					of the album was a line taken from that song.
