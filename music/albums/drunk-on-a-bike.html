									One night when I was so bored<br>
									I took my bike for a ride<br>
									I went down to the local pub<br>
									To see who was inside<br>
									Some friends of mine were at the bar<br>
									Just drinking back the ale<br>
									I knew that I would join them soon<br>
									I knew this without fail<br>
									<br>
									We drank until the places was dry<br>
									We drank the whole night through<br>
									I found my way as best I could<br>
									It's all that I could do<br>
									I got onto my bike again<br>
									Though my vision was impaired<br>
									And now I'm at the side of the road<br>
									Just wondering how I got there<br>
									<br>
									Chorus:<br>
									I was driving back at first light<br>
									I was blinded by the headlight<br>
									A car swerved in front of me<br>
									I skidded off and hit a tree<br>
									Now I'm lying on the ground<br>
									Hoping help will soon be found<br>
									But soon I might take a hike<br>
									I was drunk on a bike<br>
									<br>
									The cops picked me up that night<br>
									I was taken straight down-town<br>
									And though I needed first-aid<br>
									I knew I was going down<br>
									They got me on a DUI<br>
									They took my bike without a fuss<br>
									And now I have to walk everywhere<br>
									Now I take the bus<br>
									<br>

				<hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:#333;background-color:#ffffff">
				<p class="album">
					Since  
					<span class="italic bold">Drunk On A Bike</span> is my first album, 
					the songs cover the first 5 years of my writing. During this period, 
					I was listening to a variety of genres which reflects in the 
					types of styles I wrote, such as folk, rock, punk and even one heavy 
					metal song (‘Don’t Look My Way’).
				</p>
				<p class="album">
					As for the words, I usually wrote about personal experiences. The 
					title for '<span class="bold">Praying At The Altar of Rock</span>'
					was coined by a friend of mine at a Tragically Hip concert. The lyrics 
					in the song reflect the experience of that concert. After losing my 
					first full-time job, I wrote '<span class="bold">Another Page Has Turned</span>', 
					'<span class="bold">Epic Fail</span>' 
					and '<span class="bold">Farewell</span>' as goodbyes... 
					well except 'Epic Fail'.
				</p>
				<p class="album">
					Some songs were ideas that turned into stories. For the 
					<span class="bold">title track</span> 
					and '<span class="bold">I See Through Your Honesty</span>', I 
					either thought up the title, or heard it somewhere, and then 
					created a story to go with it.
				</p>
				<p class="album">
					I also enjoy writing songs about historical events or places. In the case 
					'<span class="bold">The Ghosts of The Money Pit</span>', I wrote about 
					the Oak Island Money Pit in Nova Scotia and one of its legends after I 
					visited the island in 2009.
				</p>
				<p class="album">
					I was encouraged by my friends to give the album the title 
					<span class="italic bold">Drunk On A Bike</span> 
					in the hopes of selling more albums. Only time will tell.

				<h4>1. Praying At The Altar of Rock</h4>
				<p class="lyrics">
					The music starts, the chant begins<br>
					It rocks my heart, repents my sins<br>
					<br>
					The preacher preaches from the stage<br>
					We know the speeches, we explode in rage<br>
					<br>
					Chorus:<br>
					I'm praying at the altar of rock<br>
					I'm praying at the altar of rock<br>
					<br>
					The hymn is sung, a prayer for all<br>
					Everyone can sing that call<br>
					<br>
					The sounds sink in and I’m amazed<br>
					I’d like to feel this everyday<br>
					<br>
					[Chorus]<br>

				<h4>2. Curious To The Point of Apathy</h4>
				<p class="lyrics">
					It seemed so long ago<br>
					I guess it was<br>
					There's not much we could do<br>
					We were just kids<br>
					<br>
					Looking back on all those times<br>
					Certain things come back to mind<br>
					Some remembered, some I'll never find<br>
					I must leave it all behind<br>
					<br>
					Chorus:<br>
					I'm curious to the point of apathy<br>
					To know what happened to you<br>
					I'm curious to the point of apathy<br>
					To know what I can do<br>
					<br>
					We were the best of friends<br>
					I know it's true<br>
					But this I couldn't see<br>
					You were so blue<br>
					<br>
					Looking back on all those times<br>
					Most were happy most were fine<br>
					Wishing sometimes I could just rewind<br>
					I must leave it all behind<br>
					<br>
					[Chorus]<br>

				<h4>3. Drunk On A Bike</h4>
				<p class="lyrics">
					One night when I was so bored<br>
					I took my bike for a ride<br>
					I went down to the local pub<br>
					To see who was inside<br>
					Some friends of mine were at the bar<br>
					Just drinking back the ale<br>
					I knew that I would join them soon<br>
					I knew this without fail<br>
					<br>
					We drank until the places was dry<br>
					We drank the whole night through<br>
					I found my way as best I could<br>
					It's all that I could do<br>
					I got onto my bike again<br>
					Though my vision was impaired<br>
					And now I'm at the side of the road<br>
					Just wondering how I got there<br>
					<br>
					Chorus:<br>
					I was driving back at first light<br>
					I was blinded by the headlight<br>
					A car swerved in front of me<br>
					I skidded off and hit a tree<br>
					Now I'm lying on the ground<br>
					Hoping help will soon be found<br>
					But soon I might take a hike<br>
					I was drunk on a bike<br>
					<br>
					The cops picked me up that night<br>
					I was taken straight down-town<br>
					And though I needed first-aid<br>
					I knew I was going down<br>
					They got me on a DUI<br>
					They took my bike without a fuss<br>
					And now I have to walk everywhere<br>
					Now I take the bus<br>
					<br>
					[Chorus 2x]<br>
