He came to Lower Canada in 1816 and joined the services of Philemon Wright, the founder of Hull. When he earned enough capital, he went out on his own and purchased a 200 acre lot on the south side of the Ottawa River (lot C, concession C in Nepean Township) for \u00a395 in 1821. However, due to legal technicalities, the property was not fully his until 1830.<br>Although successful in the timber trade, Sparks true success was in land purchases. With the building of the Rideau Canal in 1826, Sparks sold the west part of his property for \u00a3200 per acre. He also divided up his property over time for the new community of Bytown. Today, Sparks Street sits on the lot that Nicholas Sparks once owned.",

He left Ireland again in 1826 to the US to try again, settling in upper New York State. Finding little opportunity, he found out about the construction of the Rideau Canal and travelled to Bytown in 1827.

After his military career, he became prime minister of Britain from 1828 to 1830 and for a short time in 1834. While as Master-General of Ordnance (the part of the government in charge of fortifications and canals), he was a great advocate for the construction of the Rideau Canal.",

He became the assistant engineer in charge of the location and construction of the Welland Canal from Port Dalhousie to Thorold and remained in this position from 1841 to 1845. He moved to Bytown in 1845 to become assistant engineer on the improvement works of the Ottawa River. In 1847, he married Esther Sparks, the youngest daughter of Nicholas and Sarah Sparks. For his son-in-law, Nicholas renamed Waugh Street to Slater Street. In 1849, he was appointed a provincial land surveyor and later became the superintendent of the Rideau Canal from 1858 to 1872. While in Ottawa, he served as chairman of the public school board from 1863 to 1870.",

MacLaren came to Upper Canada from Scotland in 1822 with his family. After the family moved to Wakefield, Lower Canada in th 1840s, he formed James MacLaren and Company with his brother. He established a general store, gristmill, woollen mill and brick-making plant. He also was involved with the timber trade along the Gatineau River. All his ventures proved successful and in 1866, MacLaren purchased the New Edinburgh Mills from Thomas McKay's estate for $82,000. By 1871, the sawmill was producing lumber valued at $150,000 a year. He expanded further in Buckingham where he eventually centred his operations. He co-founded and was president of the Bank of Ottawa, he was the founding directory of Hull Iron Company Limited, he was directory of the Ontario Central Railway and continued to expand his lumber investments in other parts of Ontario and the United States. At the time of his death, his obituary reported his estimated wealth at 5 million dollars.",
