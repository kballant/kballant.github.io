	<h3>Canadian Cartographic Association Conference Presentation</h3>
	<p>On June 1, 2017, I gave a presentation at the 
	<a href="http://cca-acc.org/conferences/current-conference/">Canadian Cartographic Associations Annual Conference</a>
	held in Ottawa at Carleton University. The talks given at the conference
	provided many different and fascinating ideas on how cartographic techniques can be 
	applied. The conference looked at the past, present and future of mapping. I presented my buildings
	topic as an example of how to map the past. Below is a copy of my presentation.
