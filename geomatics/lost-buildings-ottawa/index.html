		<h2>Lost Buildings of Ottawa</h2>
	</div>
	<hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:#333;background-color:#ffffff">
	<p>Through the years, Ottawa has seen many buildings come and go. Some were lost to fire, 
	some demolished for the expansion of parkland, roads and other improvements while others
	were removed to make way for newer buildings.</p>

	<p>This project provides information and photos of these buildings. The information is 
	provided in a Google Earth KML file with footprints for each building overlayed in 
	various colours (see the map below).</p>
	
	<p>Please note that the KML file was designed using Google Earth so for best results, 
	<a href="/geomatics/files/Lost_Ottawa_Buildings.kml">download</a>
	the KML file and view it in Google Earth.</p>

	<p>
		The location of each building is based on the 1912 Fire Insurance map sheets found at 
		<a href="http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&lang=eng&rec_nbr=3816030">
			Library & Archives Canada
		</a>
		. Each sheet was georeferenced using software QGIS, GDAL and Google Earth. To download a 
		KMZ file of one of the fire insurance plans, please go to the 
		<a href="/geomatics/fire-plans">Fire Insurance Plans page.</a>
	</p>
	
	<p>Since all historic information is based on the 1912 insurance maps, no buildings 
	demolished prior to 1912 will be included in the KML file.</p>

	<p>Photos of buildings have been collected from sites on the Internet. 
	Click on any photo to navigate to the source (only works if viewing in Google Earth).</p>

	<p>This project is an on-going process so please visit this site in the future as the 
	KML file will be updated whenever possible.</p>
