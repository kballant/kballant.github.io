		<h2>Ottawa's 1930 Railway Network</h2>

	<hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:#333;background-color:#ffffff">
	<p>At the height of rail transportation, most North American cities had extensive railway networks and Ottawa was no exception. Starting with the Bytown and Prescott Railway in 1854, Ottawa’s railway network expanded to over 120 km, 2 stations and 3 railway companies by 1930. With the implementation of much of the Greber Plan, Ottawa’s railway lines were moved from the downtown to the suburbs and replaced with highways and parkways by the late 1960s. Since then, the city’s move from heavy industry to high-tech businesses has seen its railway system diminish to two intercity passenger train lines (to Montreal and Toronto), light rail and one short branch for freight to Arnprior. However, many of the original rights-of-way still exist as pathways, roadways or just abandoned lines.</p>
	<p>I created this map to show Ottawa’s railway network at its height in 1930. Information on the railway lines was gathered using <a href="https://ocul.on.ca/topomaps/collection/">historic topographic maps</a> and air photos from the <a href="http://gsguo.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=4c010ecf0fb3434890214fa63c942928">University of Ottawa</a> and <a href="http://maps.ottawa.ca/geoottawa/">GeoOttawa</a>.</p>

	<!-- <p>This project includes an online map showing the outline footprint of buildings which 
	existed in 1912 but no longer exist today. Each footprint contains information and photos
	of these buildings.
	
	<p>The map can be viewed using the 
	<a href="/geomatics/bygone-buildings-ottawa/map">online map</a>
	or using the provided 
	<a href="/geomatics/files/Ottawa_Bygone_Buildings.kml">KML file</a>
	which can be viewed in Google Earth.</p>

	<p>There is also a <a href="./building-list.html">list of the buildings</a>.</p>
	
	<p>
		The location of each building is based on the 1912 Fire Insurance map sheets found at 
		<a href="http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&lang=eng&rec_nbr=3816030">
			Library & Archives Canada
		</a>
		. Each sheet was georeferenced using software QGIS, GDAL and Google Earth. To download a 
		KMZ file of one of the fire insurance plans, please go to the 
		<a href="/geomatics/fire-plans">Fire Insurance Plans page.</a>
	</p>
	
	<p>Since all historic information is based on the 1912 insurance maps, no buildings 
	demolished prior to 1912 will be included in the KML file.</p>

	<p>Photos of buildings have been collected from sites on the Internet. 
	Click on the source link below the photos to navigate to their source.</p>

	<p>This project is on-going so please visit this site in the future as the 
	KML file will be updated whenever possible.</p>
